# Mind Hacks, Electric Twin Hackathon
## Housing Track Submission
Concerns about affordability predominately drive the demand-side of the housing crisis. Individuals, particularly millennials and Gen Z, view homeownership as a pipe dream. Yet meeting demand - through increasing supply of housing - poses a range of issues; while there is general agreement that there should be increases in housing provision, securing planning permissions approved can prove difficult. Developers must navigate local authority approval processes, which vary in their likelihood of rejection. The likelihood of approval often depends on the motivations of local residents, some of whom actively resist new developments and willingly embrace the label of ‘NIMBY.’          

This site addresses the fundamental question:       
> Why are we not building more homes?     

More specifically, we map the likelihood of gaining planning permissions for dwellings by local authority. We also overlay possible proxies for constituents’ concerns, to determine whether factors like school overcrowding, increased hospital waiting times, homeowner property value anxiety, or congestion concerns may explain locals’ resistance to planning approvals.
